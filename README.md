## Part of Weather Display

I created this to be integrated into my Weather Display sketch 
so I could see the weather forecast in more than one location.

This is not perfect.  I'm sure there are better ways to write this
but being new to this I didn't see another/better way.

If you find this and have any suggestions on how to make it 
better please let me know.
